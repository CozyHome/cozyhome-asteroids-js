					This ended up not using the DGJK(...) for narrowphase contact generation. The problem being that
					continuous collision detection using my naive raycasting algorithm is horrible for precision. Entities end up intersecting regardless of the techniques used to solve the problem. I assume the issue is much more nuanced than I can handle at the moment. <br><br>I have other things to do and this isn't a priority right now. At the moment, a broadphase quadtree spatial partitioning data structure is used to sort for locality and assist in the nearest neighbors sub-problem for moving particles. <br><br>Bounding boxes are inflated/supported via minkowski addition of a translation vector and the current frame's AABB. This box is queried against the quadtree and is notified/told all intersecting potential contact pairs. It was supposed to serve as a broadphase step, but ended up being the entire resolver due to floating point imprecision induced by the gilbert johnson keerthi. <br><br>I'm a little upset but overall the project turned out successful for what I wanted to achieve.
