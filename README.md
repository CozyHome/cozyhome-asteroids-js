This repository houses my attempt at implementing Asteroids in JS. It's really just an excuse to create an AABB library and utilize it with some form of quad-tree or AABB-tree esque structure as the broad phase. DGJK will be used as a narrow phase collision system with both CCD and DC solvers for the player against all items in the scene.

As always, this will be assisted with p5js and P2D to make bootstrapping easy.
